Final Assignment: Build, Organize, and Deploy a Multipage Website

By: Tshegofatso Moloto – Software Engineering Student

Hi! 👋
This is my final project for the module on building, organizing, and deploying a multipage website. The goal is to demonstrate my ability to create a responsive, interactive, and production-ready website using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript, while following best practices for structure, code organization, and deployment.

Part 1: Planning and Organizing the Website

Website Purpose:

This website serves as my personal portfolio, showcasing my skills, projects, and contact information.

Pages:

Home – Introduction and featured projects

About – Personal background and skills

Projects – Detailed portfolio of completed work

Contact – Contact form and social links

Gallery – Visual showcase of projects or screenshots

Layout Sketch / Description:

Header: Navigation menu linking all pages

Footer: Contact info, social links, and copyright

Main Content: Each page has a consistent layout with unique content and at least one interactive element

Navigation Map:

All pages are linked through the header navigation for seamless internal navigation.

Part 2: Building the Website

HTML5 Structure:

Semantic tags (<header>, <main>, <footer>, <section>, <article>) used for accessibility and clarity

Consistent header/footer across all pages

CSS Features:

Responsive layout using Flexbox and CSS Grid

Color scheme, typography, and spacing consistent across pages

Animations for buttons, project cards, and scroll effects

JavaScript Features:

Toggle menu for mobile view

Form validation on the contact page

Interactive project cards (flip or hover animations)

Dynamic content load (optional – e.g., loading project details)

Interactive Examples:

Home Page: Button hover animations

Projects Page: Card flip animations

Contact Page: Form validation alerts and feedback

Part 3: Best Practices for Code Organization

Folder Structure:

│
├─ images/
│   └─ ...             ← All images/screenshots used on the site
│
└─ README.md           ← Project explanation and live URL


Code Practices:

Meaningful file and variable names

Modular CSS and JS for readability

Proper commenting to explain sections of code

HTML and CSS validated for errors

Tested across mobile and desktop viewports

Part 4: Hosting and Deployment

Chosen Hosting Platform:

GitHub Pages for static portfolio deployment

Deployment Steps:

Created a GitHub repository: https://github.com/tshego-code/final-portfolio

Pushed all website files to the main branch

Enabled GitHub Pages from the repository settings

Confirmed all pages and scripts load correctly on both desktop and mobile

Live website URL:
https://tshego-code.github.io/final-portfolio/

Deliverables

Complete Project Code – Organized in folders (css, js, images)

README.md – Explaining project purpose, structure, and live URL

Live Deployed Website – Fully functional, responsive, and interactive

Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I learned how to:

Plan and organize a multipage website effectively

Use HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript to create responsive and interactive pages

Apply best practices for code organization and readability

Test the website across devices to ensure a consistent user experience

Deploy a project to GitHub Pages for a live, shareable URL
